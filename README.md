Automate the emptying of a dehumidifier bucket

This is my second foray into automation; the first was a brief experiment with "smart" light bulbs.

The plan here is to program a microcontroller to sense the "bucket full" light; when the light turns on, run a small aquarium pump to empty the bucket.

The initial plan is to use:

* Adafruit Feather RP2040
* Adafruit APDS9960 Proximity, Light, RGB, and Gesture Sensor - STEMMA QT / Qwiic
* Adafruit Non-Latching Mini Relay FeatherWing
